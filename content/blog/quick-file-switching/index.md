DevTools provides a 'panel' like most code editors. From here you can achieve multiple actions.

One time saving action is switching between files. To do this, follow the steps below to improve your workflow:

1. With DevTools open, hit **Ctrl + P (Cmd + P)**
2. A panel will pop up, type the file name within the search area.
3. Hit **enter** to open that file in DevTools sources.
