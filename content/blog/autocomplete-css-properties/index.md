Can't remember a CSS property name but know the value you need?

Chrome DevTools has you covered!

Within the element.style section in DevTools start typing the value you want to use. If recognised, DevTools will create auto suggestions saving you time.

> Example: You know you want your text to be 'italic' but can't remember the 'font-style' property.

1. Type 'italic' into the element.style section.
2. DevTools will auto suggest: 
```css
font-style:italic
```
3. Magic.
