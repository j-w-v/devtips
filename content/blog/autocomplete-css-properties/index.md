Can't remember a CSS property name but know the value you need?

Chrome DevTools has you covered!

Within the element.style section in DevTools start typing the value you want to use. If recognised, DevTools with create auto suggestions saving you time.

Example:

1. Type 'italic' into the element.style section.
2. DevTools will auto suggest: 
```css
font-style:italic
```
3. Magic.
