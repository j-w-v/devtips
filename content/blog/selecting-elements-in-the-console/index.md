The DevTools console provides you with shorterned element selectors to quicken your workflow.

Listed below are three variables and their explanations:

1. **$0 - $4** : A history of the five most recent DOM elements that you've selected in the elements panel, $0 being the last.
2. **$$()** : A shortened version of document.querySelectorAll() which returns an array of the given CSS selector.
3. **$()** : A shortened version of document.querySelector() which returns the first element, matching a given CSS selector.
