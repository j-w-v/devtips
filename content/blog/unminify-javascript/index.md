JavaScript files are minimised to reduce size and load time but this makes them illegible. 

Click on a JavaScript file within the 'page' pane and if it's minimised use the steps below.

1. Naviage to the 'editor' pane. (The pane showing the code)
2. Find the two curly brackets at the bottom. They will look like this `{ }`
3. Click them and you will given a formatted version of the JavaScript file selected.
